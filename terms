25. Dispute Resolution, Arbitration; Jurisdiction

PLEASE READ THE FOLLOWING SECTION CAREFULLY BECAUSE IT REQUIRES YOU TO ARBITRATE CERTAIN DISPUTES AND CLAIMS WITH MINDS AND LIMITS THE MANNER IN WHICH YOU CAN SEEK RELIEF FROM US.

Binding Arbitration. Except for any disputes, claims, suits, actions, causes of action, demands or proceedings (collectively, “Disputes”) in which either Party seeks injunctive or other equitable relief for the alleged unlawful use of intellectual property, including, without limitation, copyrights, trademarks, trade names, logos, trade secrets or patents, you and Minds (i) waive your and Minds’ respective rights to have any and all Disputes arising from or related to these Terms resolved in a court, and (ii) waive your and Minds’ respective rights to a jury trial. Instead, you and Minds will arbitrate Disputes through binding arbitration pursuant to the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. § 1 et seq. (“FAA”), to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law. (This includes the referral of a Dispute to one or more persons charged with reviewing the Dispute and making a final and binding determination to resolve it instead of having the Dispute decided by a judge or jury in court).

No Class Arbitrations, Class Actions or Representative Actions. Any Dispute arising out of or related to these Terms is personal to you and Minds and will be resolved solely through individual arbitration and will not be brought as a class arbitration, class action or any other type of representative proceeding. There will be no class arbitration or arbitration in which an individual attempts to resolve a Dispute as a representative of another individual or group of individuals. Further, a Dispute cannot be brought as a class or other type of representative action, whether within or outside of arbitration, or on behalf of any other individual or group of individuals.

Notice; Informal Dispute Resolution. Each Party will notify the other Party in writing of any Dispute within thirty (30) calendar days of the date it arises, so that the Parties can attempt in good faith to resolve the Dispute informally. Notice to Minds shall be sent by email to Minds at [info@minds.com]. Notice to you shall be by email to the then-current email address in your Account. Your notice must include (i) your name, postal address, email address and telephone number, (ii) a description in reasonable detail of the nature or basis of the Dispute, and (iii) the specific relief that you are seeking. If you and Minds cannot agree how to resolve the Dispute within thirty (30) calendar days after the date notice is received by the applicable Party, then either you or Minds may, as appropriate and in accordance with these Terms, commence an arbitration proceeding or, to the extent specifically provided for in these Terms, file a claim in court.

Process. Any arbitration will occur in the State of Connecticut. Arbitration will be conducted confidentially by a single arbitrator in accordance with the rules of the Judicial Arbitration and Mediation Services (“JAMS”), which are hereby incorporated by reference. The state and federal courts located in the State of Connecticut will have exclusive jurisdiction over (i) any appeals and the enforcement of an arbitration award, or (ii) any claim filed in court where permitted in these Terms.

Authority of Arbitrator. As limited by the FAA, these Terms and the applicable JAMS rules, the arbitrator will have (i) the exclusive authority and jurisdiction to make all procedural and substantive decisions regarding a Dispute, including the determination of whether a Dispute is arbitrable, and (ii) the authority to grant any remedy that would otherwise be available in court; provided, however, that the arbitrator does not have the authority to conduct a class arbitration or a representative action, which is prohibited by these Terms. The arbitrator may only conduct an individual arbitration and may not consolidate more than one individual’s claims, preside over any type of class or representative proceeding or preside over any proceeding involving more than one individual.

Rules of JAMS. The rules of JAMS and additional information about JAMS are available on the JAMS website. By agreeing to be bound by these Terms, you either (i) acknowledge and agree that you have read and understand the rules of JAMS, or (ii) waive your opportunity to read the rules of JAMS and any claim that the rules of JAMS are unfair or should not apply for any reason.

Injunctions and Court Proceedings. With respect to any action or proceeding for which courts are an expressly permitted method of adjudication hereunder (set forth below), the exclusive jurisdiction and venue for all such actions or proceedings arising out of, or related to, these Terms will be in an appropriate state or federal court located in the State of Connecticut. (the “Designated Courts”), and the Parties hereby irrevocably consent to the personal and subject matter jurisdiction of such court, waive any claim that such courts do not constitute a convenient and appropriate venue for such actions or proceedings, and waive the right to a trial by jury. Each Party consents to service of process upon itself by means of any of the methods for delivery of notice that are specified in these Terms.

To the extent that arbitration pursuant to the terms of this section is not permitted under applicable law, a Party may seek resolution of any dispute in the Designated Courts.

To the extent the Parties mutually-agree to forego arbitration for a dispute, the Parties shall seek resolution of such dispute in the Designated Courts.

Permitted appeals and/or enforcement of an arbitration award shall take place in the Designated Courts.

Certain breaches of these Terms by a User may, by its gravity or nature, cause immediate and irreparable injury to Minds that cannot be adequately compensated for in damages, including, without limitation, infringement of Minds’ intellectual property rights. Accordingly, notwithstanding anything to the contrary in these Terms, in the event of any such breach and in addition to all other remedies available herein, Minds may seek solely injunctive relief from the Designated Courts without posting a bond or other security.
26. Governing Law

These Terms will be governed by and construed and enforced in accordance with the laws of the State of Connecticut, without regard to conflict of law rules or principles (whether of the State of Connecticut or any other jurisdiction) that would cause the application of the laws of any other jurisdiction.
27. Waiver and Severability

No waiver by Minds of any term or condition set out in these Terms shall be deemed a further or continuing waiver of such term or condition or a waiver of any other term or condition, and any failure of Minds to assert a right or provision under these Terms shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision.

If any provision of these Terms is held by a court or other tribunal of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable for any reason, such provision shall be eliminated or limited to the minimum extent such that the remaining provisions of these Terms will continue in full force and effect.
28. Notice
